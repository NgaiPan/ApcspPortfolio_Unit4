    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">5)Are you willing to trade some of your privacy for the convenience of having a computer or a company recommend products to you? Why or why not? Under what circumstances?</p>
    <p style="font-size: 110%;">&nbsp;I will trade some of your privacy for the convenience of having a computer or a company recommend products to me if they only ask what kind of products I want,but I wouldn't tell them my personal information.Because if they know my personal information,they would send a lot of ads to my email and mail.But if they only want what kind of products customer like,that would help a lot for me to find out what I want.</p>
    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">6)How do we leave digital "footprints and fingerprints?" Do you think this is important for everyone to know? Why or why not?</p>

    <p style="font-size: 110%;">&nbsp;We should not send the data to other company,social media,and other people without asking the user.</p>
    <p style="color: #AD7DD5; font-size: 150%;">9)Search the web for a recent news story that deals with privacy. Write a paragraph summarizing the article, including any beneficial or harmful impacts on privacy.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 110%;">&nbsp;I found a recent news story that deals with privacy call "Do you want your company to know how fit you are?
"And there is the
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-33261116">Link</a>.This story is talking about some companies offered their employees fitness trackers and employees are fitter base on the data they collect.That is beneficial for the employees because they are fitter,but the company may sell their employees data to other companies,and track your steps, calorie intake and sleep patterns.
